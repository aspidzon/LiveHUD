Are these neccesary? Maybe.

1. move the AbletonJS folder into 
      Windows: C:\Users\[your user]\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts
      MacOS: idk. please, someone with macos do this
2. move the LiveHUD folder wherever you want.
3. open Ableton Live and go to Preferences > Link/MIDI and select AbletonJS as Control Surface
4. open the LiveHUD folder with your terminal and run the following. Don't close the terminal after that.
        npm init -y
        npm install ableton-js express socket.io
5. run the following command:
        node index.js
6. Open http://localhost:3000

it should all work. xoxo!
