## 🛠️ Built With / Créditos

This project would not be possible without the amazing job of **[ableton-js](https://github.com/leolabs/ableton-js)** made by [Leo Labs](https://github.com/leolabs).

* **Ableton-js**: doing all bidirectional communication between Ableton Live using MIDI Remote Scripts.
* **Socket.io**: for real time communication between the server and browser.
* **Express**: for web interface.

This project is inspired by the need for AbleSet and the inability to buy it. So I made it with the wonderful help of AI.
Even though, I'm trying to make it better or at least add things I'd like to have, I'm making it my way, and I hope it's useful for someone else that had the same problem as me.
My idea is to make it have a little bit of a 'pretty' interface, because I think there's nothing else to do on the backend. Any bugs/problems/ideas if they're great and posted here but not answered by me, email me at aspidzon@gmail.com and i may reply.
