# LiveHUD
## 🛠️ Built With / Créditos

This project would not be possible without the amazing job of **[ableton-js](https://github.com/leolabs/ableton-js)** made by [Leo Labs](https://github.com/leolabs).

* **Ableton-js**: doing all bidirectional communication between Ableton Live using MIDI Remote Scripts.
* **Socket.io**: for real time communication between the server and browser.
* **Express**: for web interface.
--------------------------
LiveHUD is a simple Ableton companion webapp to view current locator's name, time remaining to the next one (and elapsed to the current) and more on any device that can run a webpage!
